	<h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>
    <p>My name is Cayden Nestor. I am currently a Sophomore enrolled in El Camino High School. I graduate in the class of 2028. My interests include, video games, movies, watching and sometimes playing soccer, fashion, and shoes. Take a look around my website and feel free to let me know of any mistakes, questions, or anything you like.</p>
    <p>To create what this I started with the header, finding a color palette, including basic basic information, and typing out the main body. I did change my color palette a couple times but this is what I settled on. I also added the footer which was easy, I just created a smaller header on the bottom and then added the copyright information.&nbsp; &nbsp; After getting the basics I created other pages for my website to start creating a navigation bar. I styled the rest of the pages and added the basics to all of them to prep them for the navigation like a header and basic info for each of the pages like the about me page and soon the favorites things and contact me page. I created the navigation bar by linking buttons to the other pages so when you click on them they would take you to the other pages.I did the styling later on. Finally to complete this page I created the 3 colums at the bottom that are each styled. I made them grow when you hover over them and change color. I also added basic descriptions to them explains what the button below each one takes them to. I completed the whole thing by styling it with CSS.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
